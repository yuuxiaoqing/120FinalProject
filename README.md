Notes:
Our game is a burger building adventure game. 
FINAL GAME REQUIREMENTS 6/07/2020
We believe our game fulfills all the requirements in terms of aesthetics and functionality.
A helpful tip for the graders:
Always double jump at the edge of the platform!! Play around with the jumps and double jumps
to get a feel for it. The map is pretty big, so don't get discouraged if you don't find an
ingredient monster immediately, they are there, we promise.

Our game runs without any critical errors.
Our game includes a title screen, a credits screen, an ending, and a return to menu that allows the player to play the game again.
We have tutorial screen for players to learn the control.
The game can be completed very easily.
Our chosen theme is "Scale", you play as a tiny chef gathering ingredients in a big big world to build a big big burger(big compared to you).
